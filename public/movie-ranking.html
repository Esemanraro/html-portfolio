<H1>MY UNDISPUTABLE OPINION WHICH IS NEVER WRONG</H1>
<H2> TOP 3 MOVIES OF ALL TIME (only right list all the other ones are wrong)</H2>
<hr>
<h3>American Psycho</h3>

<p>An insightful and violent look into the horrors that capitalism has inflicted upon humanity,
     a satirical exaggeration (SOMETIMES) of the predatory behaviors that the rat race festers
     into our human experience.
      </p>

<h3>The Matrix</h3>

<p>A parable of truth vs bliss, in the shiniest coat of paint possible. 
    It's like Thomas Gray, but with akimbo mini UZIs.  </p>

    <h3>Blade Runner</h3>
<p> A slow burner that give the viewer time to really take in the questions
    proposed by its writers and directors; mainly- What it means to be real. 
    An inquisitive exploration of how conciousness and sentience is defined,
    and the limits therein.
